# Heart-Disease-Classification

This is the project of the Machine Learning course in Zewail City of Science and Technology.

Achieved performance: 94.1%

Models implemented:
 * Logistic Regression
 * KNN
 * Random Forest
 * SVM

Different essential pre-processing procedures are applied to the heart attack
dataset before ftting different classifcation models. Cross validation and grid
search procedures are also applied in different situations. The logistic regression
model with five principal components turned out to be the best model
depending on the test performance metrics. The ethical and professional
considerations and responsibility are studied for such models.
